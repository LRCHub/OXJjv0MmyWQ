We are just fun on a trial run
Does it make us cool to
Play this out 'til summer?
Kiss in the car, meeting in the park
Did I ever doubt that you
Could be this far out?
And you're not the guy you
Always wanted to be
Imagination running wild like the 70s
Bet you don't know where the time goes
I'm not coming back to watch
You wearing your heart out
Did you think that I was down for whatever?
'Cause I don't wanna hate you
More than you'll ever know
Talk about us waking up from the summer
Guess it's a frame of mind
Praying that you wouldn't call it vanilla
I don't wanna teach you
Shit you don't understand
Call me something bittersweet
'cause you're clever
It's just a frame of mind
Where are we now? What's the lowdown?
Can I play the fool for
What feels like a lifetime?
Driving so far, kissing in the dark
Did I ever think that you
Could be a sell out?
And I'm not the girl you always want me to be
Manipulation on the road from monogamy
Bet you don't know where my mind goes
Bet you don't know, oh, oh
Did you think that I was down for whatever?
'Cause I don't wanna hate you
More than you'll ever know
Talk about us waking up from the summer
Guess it's a frame of mind
Praying that you wouldn't call it vanilla
I don't wanna teach you
Shit you don't understand
Call me something bittersweet
'cause you're clever
It's just a frame of mind
We are just vanilla
We weren't always so bland
But we were just fun on a trial run
Oh, it was a frame of mind
Got a lot to learn in love
I know who you'll put your money on
When it's all to play for
Guess you never had the nerve, did you?
It's just a frame of mind
Did you think that I was down for whatever?
'Cause I don't wanna hate you
More than you'll ever know
Talk about us waking up from the summer
Guess it's a frame of mind
Praying that you wouldn't call it vanilla
I don't wanna teach you
Shit you don't understand
Call me something bittersweet
'cause you're clever
It's just a frame of mind
