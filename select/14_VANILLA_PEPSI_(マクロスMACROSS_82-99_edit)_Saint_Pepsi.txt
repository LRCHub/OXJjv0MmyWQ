VANILLA PEPSI (マクロスMACROSS 82-99 Edit) - Saint Pepsi
I'd like this tenderness
Fire
I'd like this tenderness
Fire
I'd like this tenderness
Fire
I'd like this tenderness
I'd like this
Fire
I'd like this
I'd like this
Fire
I'd like this
I can feel the love the tenderness
In your eyes
'Cause I'd like this
Going high above
'Cause I'd like this
I can fly high
'Cause I'd like this
'Cause I'd like this
Fire
