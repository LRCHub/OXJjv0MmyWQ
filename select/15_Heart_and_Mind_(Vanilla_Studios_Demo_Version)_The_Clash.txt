My mind say stop, my heart say go
My heart say kill, my mind say no
I dont know which way should I choose?

But I know a man, hes my friend
But he steals from a family of friends
But I could never tell that man goodbye

I got a heart, I got a mind
But I cant keep callin' time
I got a heart, I got a mind
But I cant keep callin' time

Its the same for everyone
Stuck between the right and wrong
But you just gonna tell ya which way

Someone comes and someone kills
Someone chews a lot of pills
But you can put your self up to say so

You got a heart, you got a mind
But you cant keep callin' time
You got a heart, you got a mind
But you cant keep callin' time

If only I could keep my heart and mind in tact
But sometimes someones wise
Sometimes I want

I got a heart, I got a mind
But I cant tell love apart
I got a heart, I got a mind
But I cant tell love apart

Heart, I got a mind
But I cant keep callin' time
I got a heart, I got a mind
But I cant tell love apart

Its very difficult

We got the keys to your heart
I got the keys, keys to your heart, heart
And I got em on my chain, on my chain

I got the keys to your heart, heart
And I got em on my chain, on my chain
I got the keys, keys to your heart, heart
And I got em on my chain, on my chain

I got the keys, keys to your heart, heart
And I got em on my chain, on my chain
I got the keys, keys to your heart, heart
And I got em on my chain, on my chain
On my chain
