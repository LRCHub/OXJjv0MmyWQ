I remember summer evenings sitting on the front porch
And the songs me and grandma used to sing
Faded love wildwood flower yellow rose of texas
Melodies that started me to dream of bigger things
So i threw everything i owned in one old beat up suitcase
Couldn't wait to leave that place behind
I hit the highway thumbing thinking i ain't gonna' miss it
But now i find myself back on that road in my mind
I'm bluebonnet blue
There ain't no greener pastures
Than the ones that i've walked through
In my mind those memories are always in bloom
I'm bluebonnet blue
Somewhere it all got out of hand
And i left my dreams behind
Woke up alone this morning
In a lonestar state of mind come on borderline
